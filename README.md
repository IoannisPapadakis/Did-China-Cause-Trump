# Did-China-Cause-Trump
This code is part of a project (for me) to learn Python through the NYU-Stern-Econ databoot camp course (http://databootcamp.nyuecon.com/). It combines US 2016 Election data at the county level with the Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) US Trade Exposure from China data. Basically, it asks: Did China Trade Cause Trump?

This code does the following: It imports the 2016 Election Data, imports a Country FIPS code to Commuting Zone mapping and then merges it with the ADH data which measures the exposure of a commuting zone to Chinese trade. 

Still to be done: correlate the local election outcomes with the exposure measure. This is still to be done.

This relies upon three public data sets that are in the site, but can be found here:

1) 2016 US election data : https://data.world/aaronhoffman/us-general-election-2016

2) Country FIPS to Communting Zones: http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas/

3) Autor, Dorn, and Hanson data: http://www.ddorn.net/data.htm
