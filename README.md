# Did-China-Cause-Trump
This code was done as a project of learn Python at the NYU-Stern-Econ databoot camp course (http://databootcamp.nyuecon.com/)...It combines US 2016 Election data at the country level with the ADH(2013) US Trade Exposure from China data In other words it asks: Did China Cause Trump?

This code does the following: It imports the 2016 Election Data and then import the FIPS to Commuting zone mapping and then merges it with the ADH data which is performed at the commuting zone level. 

I then regress, the local election outcomes on the china import exposure measure....still to be done.
